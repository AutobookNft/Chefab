about me

Hello everyone,

My name is Fabio Cherici, and I am a passionate self-taught developer with an ambitious project that is close to my heart. Over the past two years, I have dedicated about twelve hours a day to the development of a unique NFT platform, nftFlorence.com. My journey into web development learning has been both challenging and rewarding, and I am now at a crucial stage of my project.

My Background:

Experience in Laravel, PHP, Livewire, and other web technologies.
Author of a three-volume saga, leveraging my narrative skills to enrich the platform.
Former industrial mechanic with a rich and varied life experience.
My Project:
nftFlorence.com is not just an NFT platform; it is an embodiment of my passion for art, technology, and social impact. The goal is to create an ecosystem where artists can freely express themselves, with an ethical and sustainable business model.

What I'm Looking For:

Advice on specific programming issues and best practices.
Suggestions to optimize my learning curve and effectively manage technical challenges.
A mentor or colleague with whom I can discuss ideas, receive feedback, and share progress.
My Commitment:
I am fully committed to this project and open to constructive suggestions and critiques. I appreciate any form of help, from quick advice to more in-depth discussions.

In Conclusion:
I am excited to be part of this community and hope to learn from you all, and in turn, contribute with my experiences and knowledge. Thank you for reading my introduction, and I look forward to collaborating and growing together with you in this exciting field of web development.

Best regards,
Fabio Cherici
